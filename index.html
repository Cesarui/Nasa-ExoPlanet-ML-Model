            <h2 class="body-text" style="color: #fc4503">
            An exoplanet is a planet beyond our solar system. These distant worlds come in many sizes and forms, such as gaseous giants like Jupiter or rocky pebbles like earth.
            <br>
            Sometimes, these planets orbit a star similar to how our solar system works.

        <h1 class="body-text">How do we identify these exoplanets?</h1>
            <h2 class="body-text" style="color: #fc4503">
            When exoplanets orbit a star, we can detect the slight change in brightness of that star because of the exoplanet blocking it from our satellites' views.
            <br>
            We can graph out how much the star's brightness is dimmed (transit depth), how long its dimmed for (transit duration), and how much time is in between each dim (orbital period).
            <br>
            The resulting graph is known as a light curve. If the orbital period is consistent, the transit depth and duration fits that of a planet, then it is likely an exoplanet!
            <br>
            This method of exoplanet detection is known as the Transit method.

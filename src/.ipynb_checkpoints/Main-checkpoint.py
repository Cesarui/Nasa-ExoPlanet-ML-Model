# With the transit method, we're trying to find out whether a distant star has a planet orbiting it.
# Based on how it's brightness changes over time.

# Given a list of brightness values over time(light curve), predict whether is a planet or not(binary classification).

# To classify whether it is a planet or not we'll use the disposition score give to us in the Kepler DataSet.
# Features to take in mind, transit depth, duration, orbital period, radius and label)
